I don't feel comfortable posting my drawings elsewhere so I'll dump them here.

I drew this back in 2021 for a highschool friend who I lost contact with. She was extremely bad at Yugioh, but she for some reason had a black rose dragon lol. I drew this in autodesk sketchbook on my mom's ipad....god that sounded cringy. Sadly this is one of the few drawings I managed to recover after it was wiped.
