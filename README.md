Trying again.

(if you're seeing a shitton of commits, just know; this is basically my first actual site.)

6/1: I'm like.....sorry for not actually updating shit. But also, seems like some stuff is going on with catbox. I don't know what's going on honestly, Patreon doing this to a site I use. So from now on, files such as pictures/gifs/etc. are just gonna be hosted on github directly. Also yeah, haven't learned anything yet smh.
