it’s july and i still can’t accept it
sometimes it feels that way

Even now it feels like
I could heal slightly (normal)
And you could not
When I was healing slowly
You were
short of being gone

I wish we knew what you were going through
Through my continuous tears
I hope to know the answer someday

Even now I can’t stop myself from crying
How much longer will I cry for you

My pain may have became yours
I must apologize 
Goodnight to you
