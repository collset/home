Why does looking at you make me so sad
Wasp of pessimism 
I wonder if i’m just repeating my feelings

Light and darkness are definitely two sides of the same coin
This worldview has become mine
And if anyone doesn’t understand it
Or they try to shut me down
They can’t deny the existence of it
The fact that it exists is enough
It’s what Kyo expressed in his words
But his voice has also given me the confidence to be strong
Has he already become my strength 
I wonder

Not sure why u wrote this thoughts now abd not before
I wonder if it’s because im not crying anymore 
At the moment i mean
