Pain of the past and pain of the present

My heart is now a rusted blade
Thank you brain for doing this to me

The more and more i hide my feelings
The more sad I become
If I look back at this time
Will i blame you

Last time I could not hide my tears
This time
I will definitely hide them

Even if my heart goes 10 years into the past
My sadness still won’t go away 

My heart is still and my feet are cold
I can’t take this

My last sunshine
My ray of hope
My last hope
My ray of sunshine
I really worry if you’ll be here in the future

ね、どうしたらいんですか？
Why couldn’t I protect you
Isn’t this world just the cruelest

To live in this world without you
That is the most challenging for me

Your memory won’t be gone from this world
Please comfort me in the rest of my journey here

My heart grows dark
Your spirit feels hollow to me
I’m closing my heart off

Theres a part of me that thinks that if reita met kyo he could have been saved somehow
I hope my fumbass lookd back st this comment and thinks: wow she was ~~wrong~~ right
