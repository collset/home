Can i cry to cassis in peace? NO.
I wonder if ill ever print anything from my notes out one day
I cant go downstairs 
Forced to eat
Forced this forced that
Forced into my room
Forced here forced to do everything you shouldn’t 
I need to tape over the doorlock
If I cry too much over him i am not listening at all
I shouldn’t cry….

I’m starting to remember why i don’t draw anymore lmaooo
Jfc school out of nowhere
Maybe i should throw that sketchbook away
The empty one i mean

My brain is a fug :DDDDDDDDD

im shaken up still over everything 
but if i abandon vk i will legitimately die
sorry i meant legit feel worse
but what i typed sounds better
so i went w that 

my brain invented something
d’espairsray’s sound
but with yomi’s vocals
bruh i just KNOW it would work
it would it really would
at first it would sound a bit tryhardish
but then? it would hit i just know for a fact
yeah yomi would be so good w industrial sound
just saying
actually nvm lmao
Hizumi is still good
Coveys the message rather than the coolness 

watashi just wants to return to normalcy desu
I have to sue the bathroom

I can’t sleep because of you
But i can
I’m writing this close to the end of afternoon
But i…..I can sleep because of you
It’s because of you i can sleep
Not the other way around

I put shimejis on my computer
That way he will live on forever
I’m a little surprised that there was one for his recent look….
Old and new reita…..
On the computer together
I’m a little happier now that I’ve found that
But my tribute drawing
I still need to finish that ;3;

crazy how escapism only works when you’re 12

I closed my heart because 
i remember the time you closed yours

Anyways I’m struggling to warm up to you
A little bit by bit

because of his death i basically have to live
why do I feel stable enough to type it
I want to おやすみ but how
maybe tomorrow i can finally not consume anything
I wish i had mini shimeji on my phone
It’s all pixel art and stuff
Anyway
It’s time to relax somehow
