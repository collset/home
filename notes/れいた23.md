No matter what
I want to keep your memory alive
And i wont let you be forgotten
Ill protect your legacy 
and hold you close to my heart
__________________________
tomorrow
I want your memory close to me
I want your memory close to me
I want your m
I can’t help but tear up

I still want the strength to go on
But I don’t know if I can share that strength 
With anyone else
