Isshi
I hope you’re up there
Guiding him
I want to understand you too

Please be here
Please be here
Talking laughing smiling
My heart has to forget this feeling

I don’t want you gone forever 
Maybe that’s how it feels
in my tired chest

I feel
Like i need to hold this burden
Because their feelings break me up
And i have to do something 

Maybe its too much for me right now

Even before i sleep
I will shed one last tear

Will we ever see that smile again
My chest is hurting from thinking 

the moon today is a reflection of your owm spirit
