I fucked up
This world is still cruel for taking you away
But I honestly feel like I can’t even get close to anyone right now
Cruel ass world rn

This blue sky to comfort me
On the day I found out
Months ago

You are there
In that blue sky
I’m happy that I know my true feelings now

You are my
First
Last
Only
hope
many kinds of it
that’s how it can feel

Am i doing enough or too little
I wish I had an answer

from you

there’s sorrow embedded in my heart
didn’t i say that once before?
