Deep down you want to return here
Your pain took you from here
But we will always bring you back no matter what
You won’t leave their sight
Nor will you leave theirs
No matter what took you
You’re engraved here in everyone’s hearts
Not just mine
Don’t leave my heart
Because you’re proof that there was something right with this world

This soulless world just might consume both of us
Me and ruki

That kind part of you 
I want to feel it
The sorrow
Is all around me

Because of Aoi’s tweet I think to myself
You closed your heart so you could survive in it
The darkness in this world took you away

I can’t forgive this world for taking you away
It was too early for you to go

Connecting the younger part of myself
To you
I wonder if that’s wrong
That there’s nothing we have in common
