I know what’s in my heart
I won’t cry now

You’re there in that sky
Ill keep your memory alive

With Ruki’s words
I want to be comforted
And return that emotion back
I feel I must support you no matter what
I feel sleepy but don’t 
How will i become your strength 
I wonder

Because of his absence I am not arrogant 

It’s just my proof of strength
For you, in my eyes
You were strong for so long
Both of you
I will let Reita’s memory comfort me too
Just like your voice
I will definitely feel five of you together 
He’s here in our hearts
I won’t say such sad things to make you sad anymore 

In this cruel world 
Your memory is all i have
I want Ruki to become my strength 
I want Reita to become my strength
I want Aoi to become my strength
I want Uruha to become my strength 
I want Kai to become my strength 

I want GazettE to be my strength and lead me through 
And someday I’d like to return that to them as a sixth gun
I want them to feel loved and remembered
Even if one is gone
I want to support you regardless 

No matter what we can express ourselves 
We can say our soul is alive
That his soul is alive
