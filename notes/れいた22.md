It’s a burden on your shoulder right
To free me if that time comes

~~Everyone was saved by you~~ 
~~but no one could save you~~
These are the negative thoughts that come to mind

Remind me of your kindness somehow
I’m being eaten away

after today im not having caffeine bc wtf

You’re my angel in heaven
……..
Even though you left too early
………
Snuggle me or something 
I feel very angry and sad

my soul gets broken like before
and I won’t know what to do

throw it away in the trash
it doesn’t deserve to remember

It really feels like
You’re the first person I loved

I’ve already witnessed the horrors and darkness already
I don’t know what i should do

The side of you I couldn’t see
Now I’m being negative and going against my goal

Are you the first person that i loved?
It really feels like it

I don’t want to live in this world without you
It feels like im misunderstanding everything
