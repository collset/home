Your kindness left this world
My heart will grow cold
I will put your light out myself 
So i can protect what you had somehow

The world will swallow me whole with its cruelty

I will forever mourn the fact that we did not cross paths earlier when you were still here

Can i still connect my heart with yours
I want to snuggle you the way a child would
Because i feel like there’s no other way as a tired person 

I woke up with the feeling where are you, where are you
I hope you’re watching over them
I can’t help but worry

Why did i become this way
The hole in my slowing heart
If it stopped

A sadness that makes me tired
One that won’t make me forgive this world no matter what
Even I try to be tough
I loved you….?

The same way you loved us
Why were you an angel
I think I can’t look at the current you
Without crying

There’s darkmess in this world
Your light will burn out

this world is so dark
did we not deserve your light

A gentle memory leaves a hole in my heart 

You saw the darkness in this world
But i still have to keep loving you

I knew there was a sadness in your eyes
Even if its just in my head
