The same world that hurt me
Hurt him
I have a soul but no one to show it to

I will cheer your spirit on

I cannot forget everything you did for this band
You were an angel in this dark world

To you I say
Please don’t close your heart for our sake

In another note, Kyo is the strength in a world that has denied you/me strength/the ability to have it/gaining any
Sorry i over complicated that
I guess I have to appreciate what’s here
……
You were literally a ray of sunshine

Even now
I still believe you didn’t want to leave this world

Even now 
I refuse to believe you wanted to leave this world
Don’t screw with my emotions

There’s something wrong with this world 
Even if you’re not in it 

I wish my cruel heart could look at your cool eyes
And say, “good”
I grow curious of your pain
I wish I could go a day without thinking of you
I had to worry about you
There is something very unresolved there

I wish i didn’t cry so much
Over the fact that you couldn’t heal
Would it be wrong to call you the light in everyone’s world 
I think you knew
And you loved us back
Yet I don’t understand
What hurt you immensely 

There will come the days where I will say
“Keeping your memory alive is painful so I will let you be forgotten”
I don’t want to remember your sadness like everyone who didn’t know you
I know how much you meant to everyone around you
It’s just hard for me to accept
