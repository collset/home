im gonna buy all the reita merch i dont care anymore
if kyo were my dad he would never….
lay a hand on me ;-;

I dont know if i should say this but
the kind of feeling or vibe i get from the older users
is that they never cared much for reita at all
like in terms of him recently or his personality 
they probably didnt pay much attention 
I mean neither did i but it definitely comes off as
Them slowly and eventually 
not really caring about him
Which kind of does make sense seeing
That they were fans of him for a very long time but
Even then if they knew the band clearly struggled 
Why would they mock them for it
I mean not too long ago i saw fans in March
They were making fun of Ruki a bit for Mass
I mean it’s criticism but do you ever think
That men in their 40’s fucking struggle?
Does it not occur to you?
Because yes there are men that age who seem
To be doing kind of okay (i.e. forgive me for comparing him out of the blue but joe odagiri)
But do you ever think to yourself
That maybe deep down he truly was okay?
He was the most emotional member
He may have shown it more often in his youth but
To think that he ever left that part of him behind
Isn’t true at all
To think that he ever threw that part of himself away
Just isn’t the case
So i feel like… I don’t know
Is it because people seem to be moving on from him?
I hate speculating and that’s not what im doing here
I remember in that thread
There were many people who did not see Gazette live
I am unfortunately one of those people 
But even then…..I don’t know
I was very emotional at that time which is why I felt like I wasn’t able to reply and relate to them
Now I sadly feel that window has passed
I don’t wanna turn into the next….that bitch who kept arguing with everyone before getting b&
Idk
And then i woke up from a bad dream
Playing mario kart doesn’t seem to help my trauma
does it
anyways….
I’m not gonna have any caffeine right now
Having chicory 
Those are my thoughts for now
Also another thing id like to say
Its very unrelated but
I may be an ugly piece of shit now but
At one point i was a pretty girl
With my hair parted to the side when i was 12
Had no excess weight outside of a little bit
So……
I don’t know…..
This is just my insecurities coming out
Also downstairs i was thinking to myself
What if kyo made like asmr versions of his songs 💀
Like a Respira version or something 
And my brain was like “what if he did a little goodnight kiss at the end”
Like wtf >///<
My brain just thinks whatever
And then um he would get popular with that community
Now that actually sounds like a dream I wish I had
Instead of the fucking disgusting soulless husk imposter version of me just being passive and fucking complacent 
And then my OC showed up in my dream?? (The younger shorter on)
Like wrong OC???? 💀 Where’s the taller one
Get that bitch here to save me and stab everyone instead like wth 😭😭😭
Why am i doing NOTHING in my nightmares related to school 🤡
But yeah if Kyo did asmr shit I’d buy it 🐶
But yeah I’ve had that awful dream like twice
The one where I’m trapped in 12th grade and can’t graduate because i dropped out or I didn’t make it
Holy fucking christ like it’s just…..why is the academic system still giving me trauma
That’s probably why i made a really big deal about money being put towards keeping me in that system 
Like damn I don’t even have a choice

Whenever I’ve looked up at the sky
It’s always given me an odd feeling
I’ve always known why
Hollyhock……葵

There’s thoughts of you died for this sake
you won’t come back
I don’t really understand it
Or at least i try not to
Because….that feeling
It’s definitely
something 

I live in my own world and have no one to share it with
My metabolism is slow rn

I have to live in this world without you 

 i might have nothing but you gave me something
 That’s what I wanna tell myself reassuringly
