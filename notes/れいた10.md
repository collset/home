I’m muting my feelings
Slowly i feel as if i should close my heart again
I should strengthen it as much as i can
Before i close myself off

I can’t live in this world without either of them

That’s why….even as an adult…..
I can’t give up on true friendship
Somehow

That light in my heart
It’s withering
Just like this candle

He was the light that got tired of being too strong
This soulless world
I cannot exist in it

I have to keep going
Even though I’ll never meet you

Reita…
You were a light in this dark world
Onstage and off
I will never stop saying that
No matter what
I want to say your name confidently someday 

Why do I have to accept this world
Why do I have to live in it without you
You weren’t finished…
