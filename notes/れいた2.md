That dreamy side of you
You were hiding so much pain

I have to live in this world without you
Using my cruel words against all odds

I have to live in this world without you
That’s all that I repeat to myself these days

Could you have healed
Did you heal
You couldn’t heal
Thoughts I shouldn’t say

Why am I angry again
Towards
He’s the last person I should be angry at

I want your dream to always be a reality 
Even if you aren’t here
Even if you’re in the sky
This is what I typed yesterday 

Everyday I’m crying out for you 
Not knowing why
