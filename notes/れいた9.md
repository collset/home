In some ways I wish I’d like to be like you
Have a gentle quality to me….
I didn’t phrase that properly 

I feel like I have to live in your image
That sounds weird doesn’t it….
We’re vastly different but
If I can have that gentle quality somehow
Deep down
With all the strength you had
Then….
I don’t know….
*curls up against the wall*

Become my strength
No matter what
Become my strength
No matter what I do
No matter what harms me
You the one who cannot leave my sensitive heart
Became my strength

Can i be considered a kind person
I tried to make my heart as cruel as I could
No matter what
I could not live as an empty shell

I am a dirtied and cruel spirit
I’m your proof of this world’s state
You were what i once had
I wanted to connect that part to you

Forcing myself to be calm
It might take me away

Please protect me
Please protect them
Please protect everything you worked for

I’m begging for something to return
Knowing it can’t come back
