there’s sorrow lurking in my heart 
If i ever forget him
Then it definitely means i am no longer here
In this earth
It’s 9:30 
I’ve continuously overeaten
I wish i could eat nothing again
I recently saw an older blog
And found old stuff of gazette and reita
There a quote stuck out to me
“Suprisingly, I’m the type that cries when I see other people cry”
I actually….spent nearly 10 minutes looking for that just now
But….
It makes sense, especially with messages from the members….
I……really hoped things would’ve been different 
That maybe I would’ve been less cruel
And that maybe I should’ve understood why I shouldn’t have liked those posts…
From march….
I am….beyond torn up….
All i do is eat until it stops hurting….
Im drinking cold tea
Then ill sleep
And probably wake up to use the bathroom 
Im sorry
My thoughts were supposed to come out differently 
But i spent so long looking for this one post
So….
Off to bed i go…
おやすみ
