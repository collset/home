my interests end up becoming tools of abuse 
sometimes i mean

I think im getting trapped in my own trauma
Again and again

I want you to stay but it feels like youre going
It feels like youre gone
I mixed my feelings and messed everything up
I was doing all of this for you
But what if you didn’t want this
What if i didnt want this
I dont know
Im simply doubting everything that has happened 
When i think of you crying i simply want to pretend
That youre the cocky guy everyone knows instead 
Instead of the person that was taken away so soon

I guess you can say my nyappy worldview 
Has already disappeared 
Because of something I couldn’t win against 
While i could handle that situation in other ways
I think that enough is enough for my head

I also have to deal with getting money somehow
So I’m very much all over the place
