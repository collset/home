woke up and its 6
loud loud loud
have to charge my phone

I showered
Gonna ask my brother now
Since he’s up

The money is in my account now
So anyways
I just sobbed while listening to Hyde’s voice
Like…..someone said that Laruku don’t talk anymore
and it made me feel sad to remember that
because i don’t want it happening to gazette
I keep crying when i think of how ruki
truly feels
even though the voice of reason is like
he’s a grown ass man
so….
idk i know he needs the support of us fans
im ordering both but
i feel like if i dont ill feel anxious af
but
idk i feel like as long as i hide my feelings
from my family
then im sure itll be fine
they still don’t know about my nightmare cd
like thank fuck it came after they left lmao
and i threw away the cardboard packaging by
cutting it up
the surugaya box is still in the closet
I guess my tears are drying now
so yeah monday
I have a feeling im legit only gonna have half of what was given to me left
guess ill have to tolerate it

now as for school
I would rather buy new glasses than go back to school
im way out of date on my vision
really don’t wanna go first to school

lol did hyde dry my tears
i dont really like him that much but
idk how to describe his voice
its like telling me hey you have to accept the fact that you were a shitty soulless person in the past
but be a little stronger now
idk i first heard laruku back in 2019 from gto
i deleted my scrobbles bc his voice
brought back bad memories 
because of what i was doing before
so

took a 3 hour nap
jfc i cant eat anythung sweet anymore
i had a sandwich but
idk
maybe i should drink tea
again
but its 3 pm rn
was supposed to listen to stuff but man
like wtf
anyways still gonna eat something 
my body is so trash rn

its 7
slow day
also my thoughts were um
very…….very similar to old thought patterns
so i dont wanna get into it but
idk ill write later
