I cry but my heart is already going hollow
Nothing will bring you back will it
No matter how much caffeine i take
How much i pretend in front of others
I want to preserve this worldview somehow
Your memory
Your spirit 
Everything you worked for
Your dream
Your friendship 
I want to keep that
I never want to forget it
And go back to before
Before which was bad
You went where others couldn’t follow 
If it’s for your memory
I will never tell anyone 

Are you my pride and joy
Or am I part of the problem

When I saw Aoi’s tweet I felt like
None of us are on the same page
When it comes to expressing our sadness
I feel like it only makes the impact more noticeable 
I don’t know what im saying
I need to stop caffeine 

I need someone to tell me the same thing over and over again
I’m a weak person

Why couldn’t we save you
Is a phrase someone else said
But it still lurks in my mind

Are you really there in that sky
Will your spirit be felt in that festival
I hope you can reassure him
Somehow
My feelings are starting to become helpless
It’s just a feeling right?
……..

You are my pride and joy
I want to protect you from the people around me
This world is definitely worse off without you
Behind those cool eyes
You were hiding pain I couldn’t understand 
I cannot let you go in a very dark world
I will draw you as long as I can
You won’t be forgotten 

Will darkness overcome this world
The less and less you’re in it
It’s become cloudier and rainier
Please watch over them
I felt like I didn’t have to worry about you
Why didn’t i worry about you 
You were hiding behind your pain
Even from the ones closest to you 

Maybe if I shattered this false sense of self
I’d be able to understand you better

I want to throw away this soulless fear
And embrace your spirit and everything you’ve done
Somehow
