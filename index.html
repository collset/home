<p style="color: rgb(42, 0, 58);">Hi there. I'm Sarah and I'm 23 years old...I don't know how else to describe myself other than being into Japanese culture since I was 12. I hopped fandoms a lot throughout my teens (fangirl > games > now a mix of both). I'm from the US, if that was not obvious enough :P </p>



<p style="color: rgb(42, 0, 58);"> As far as being on the internet goes, I slowly stopped using social media after 2018, I wasn't the biggest fan.
But I came back online, because all my friends moved on after graduating. I have
stayed even more offline since 2020 and I really want to change that
somehow. (Am I supposed to put my race here, I'm Asian....(not east
asian.....well now you already know :c)</p>




              
<ul style="color: rgb(42, 0, 58);">




                <li>Games I really like: Megaten, Rune Factory, Pokemon up to gen 6 (Mystery Dungeon &amp; Ranger spinoffs).</li>




                <li>I mostly listen
to Japanese music now, but in the past I've had many different music
phases. I don't use sites like RYM anymore, but I did like vaporwave,
rap, etc. as a teenager before circling back to Jrock..</li>




                <li>I don't
read a whole lot now, but I used to love A Series of Unfortunate Events
and Cinder. The manga I'm currently reading is Shoulder A Coffin Kuro. </li>




              
</ul>




                
<p style="color: rgb(42, 0, 58);">I have many interests, such as tokusatsu, visual kei, JRPGs, etc. I
have very recently gotten back into Pokemon despite being a few gens
behind ^^; I truly hope to seek out people who also grew up with gen 4
&amp; 5. I also tend to either be too quiet or too chatty in my own
words. I've started rediscovering and discovering new interests, which
has been cheerful as it is sad.</p>

<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">My favorite bandmen ever are Reita and Kyo (they are both amazing
and beautiful men who I feel impacted by, personality and music wise).
I also like Kaito from Wizard (I think he has a really nice smile), Aki
from Laputa, and Hizumi ex. D&rsquo;espairsray. I'm also a big Sugizo
fangirl now too.&nbsp;I try to upload Visual Kei stuff on my YT channel
from things that I have bought/songs that are not easily online. I
never felt compelled to start being active online again (my horrible
personal life irl) until I saw that jrock (or just vkei) had an active
community online. I went most of my teen years being shamed for liking
Japanese things so I continued being offline/in other communities until
recently. I'm happy that it's not a thing of the past though now.</p>

interested in contacting me you'll have to do it through last.fm or
Protonmail. (kohry@protonmail), sorry. I had a bunch of accounts on

those of you who don't know, I used it primarily for toku/vkei stuff
but I mainly made it to connect more with other sixth guns after last
April happened. I ended up deleting it because in all honesty, I wanted
to see more trauma stories from other people who went through very
fucked up things like I did, but somehow jrock was able to really help
them. Instead, what I got was just glorified instagram with people
posting pictures all the time. As time went on, that made me feel even
more alone. But I tried convincing myself otherwise. Also someone who
did something very touching for me ended up deleting her account (won't
get into details), and I felt like I was done. I didn't really make any
friends on there, and reddit has far more shitty stuff on there than
good things (I don't like the popular parts of it either.) I don't
think it's necessary for me to have an account on there as of now.</small></small></small></small></small></small></small></small></li>
